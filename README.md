Path Planning Using AStar Algorithm

This project's objective is to design an algorithm for a 2D car plan a path to its goal and to track it.
The ROS Server is given by the company Xytron.

<h3>Path Planning</h3>
<h4>Transformation Matrix</h4>
The map coordinate system differs from that of the car. To make calculation simpler and with less error, the points in the car's coordinate system is transformed into the that of the map, and vice versa.
